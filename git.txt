- Configuring basic data.

git config --global --list
git config --global user.name "Renato Perini"
git config --global user.email "user@domain.com"

Configs are stored in ~/.gitconfig

- 3 - Initialize a repository.

git init

- 4 - Getting help.
git help
git help -a (subcommands)
git help -g (concept guides)
git help <command>
git help <concept>

- 5 - Committing files
git status 
git status -s
git add <filename> (staging file)
git rm --cached <filename> (unstaging file)
git commit -m "Commit Message"

- 6 - Inspecting a git repository
git log (commit history with commit id)
git log --oneline (contracted form)
git log <filename> (commit history for the file)
git log <since>..<until> (commit history between two commit id, since excluded)
git log -n 3 --oneline (just last 3 commits in contracted form)

- 7 - Branching Basics
git branch (available branches with the one currently selected)
git branch <newbranch> (creates a new branch, still not active)
git checkout <newbranch> (makes newbranch the active branch)


- 8 - Undoing changes
--- git checkout commits ---
git add . (add everything for staging in the current dir)
git commit -am "Commit message" (add everything and commit at the same time)
HEAD points to the final commit in the commit history
git checkout <commit-id> (goes back in history at specific commit-id. Put in the detached HEAD state)
It's a readonly operation. Impossible to harm the repository. All operations committed into this state
must be committed in a separate branch to be retained with git checkout -b <newbranch>)
git checkout master (going back to master from a detached head state)

--- git checkout files ---
git checkout <commit-id> <filename> (Porta il file allo stato del commit-id (revert). Il file viene effettivamente modificato, messo in staging e pronto per il commit)
git checkout HEAD <filename> (Riporta il file allo stato attuale dell'ultimo commit.)
git revert HEAD (su file committato, riporta il file allo stato precedente, facendo un nuovo commit inverso)

--- git reset ---
It should be used only to reset local copies, not changes shared with other developers.
There is no way to recover the resetted copy.
It can be used to remove changes in the commit are, staging area or local working dir changes.
git reset <filename> (on a staged file, removes the file from the staging area. The file retain the changes in the working dir and is marked as modifed, ready to be staged again)
git reset (with staged files, like the previous command but act on the whole staging area without any particular reference to any file)
git reset --hard (with staged files, like the previous command but also removes changes in the local working dir, leaving it clean)
git reset <commit-id> (with committed files, delete the commit, its history and brings the reset changes unstaged, to allow to stage and commit them again)
git reset --hard <commit-id> (with committed file, deletes the commit, its history and the staging area. All changes past the commit-id are lost)

--- git clean ---
git clean (Removes all the untracked files from the local working dir, unless clean.requireForce is set to true)
git clean -f (Removes all the untracked files from the local working dir forcibly (needed when clean.requireForce is set to true)
git clean -f <path> (Like the previous command, but limited to the path only. Leaves the path directory untouched)
git clean -df (Removes all the untracked files and directories from the local working dir)
git clean -xf (Removes all the untracked files from the local working dir plus the files that git ignores (put in the .gitignore file)
git clean -n (Makes a dry-run git clean showing which files will be removed)

- 9 - Pushing into GitHub
git remote -v (Shows which remote repo is attached to the local repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/mjordan79/remote-repo.git
git pull origin master (Pull from the remote repo)
git push -u origin master (Push to repo for the first time after adding an origin)
git push origin master (Push to the remote repo)

- 10 - GitHub via SSH
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "GitHub SSH Key"
eval $(ssh-agent -s) <-- Only if you use a passphrase inside the key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
git remote -v to test the origin connection
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git
ssh-keygen -p to add the passphrare to the key

- 12 - Git Text Editors
git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/subl.exe' -w"

- 13 - Diff and Merge tool for Git
git config --global diff.tool p4merge
git config --global difftool.p4merge.path "C:/Program files/Perforce/p4merge.exe"
git config --global difftool.prompt false (Prevents confirmation from launching the tool)
git config --global merge.tool p4merge
git config --global mergetool.p4merge.path "C:/Program files/Perforce/p4merge.exe"
git config --global mergetool.prompt false (Prevents confirmation from launching the tool)
git config --global --list to see the configuration.

- 14 - Git Comparison with git difftool (Perforce Helix Merge, p4merge)
git diff (difftool) (compares the working dir with the staging area)
git diff (difftool) -- filename (compares the working dir with the staging area restricted to one file only) 
git diff (difftool) HEAD (compares the working dir with the commit area)
git diff (difftool) --staged (--cached) [HEAD] (compares the staging area with the commit area)
git diff (difftool) <commit-id-a> <commit-id-b> (compares two commits)
git diff (difftool) HEAD^ HEAD (compares the HEAD and the commit before the HEAD)
git diff (difftool) HEAD~1 HEAD (like the previous command, but 1 can be substituted with any number)
git diff (difftool) master origin/master (compares the local repo master branch with the remote master branch)
git diff (difftool) feature_branch master (compares two branches)

- 15 - git commands
git log --online --decorate --graph --all
(--decorate puts names of branches and tags in the shown commits)
(--graph shows a hyerarchical visualization of commits and branches)
(--all include commits from other branches)
git log --stat [--oneline] [filename] (Prints statistics about insertions / deletions)
git log -p [--oneline] [-n 3](Display the log including the modifications in patch format)
git log [--oneline] <directory> (Details only relevant for the specified directory)
git log --oneline --grep="quick-feature" (search the logs for a specific expression or word)

- 16 - git branching and merging techniques
git branch (Shows available local branches)
git branch -r (Shows all the remote branches)
git branch -a (List all branches, including local and remote)
git branch branch_name (Creates a new branch from the current position)
git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name (Renames a branch)
git branch -d branch_name (Deletes the branch branch_name only if it's empty)
git branch -D branch_name (Deletes the branch branch_name even if it's not merged)
git checkout branch_name (Switch branch from the actual one to branch_name)
git checkout -b branch_name [starting_branch](Creates a new branch and switch to it, [starting from starting_branch])

-- Fast-Forward Merging --
Fast Forward merging can happen only if in the target branch there are no changes. The fact that a branch has been created is 
not visible anymore after the merge (if the branch is removed). This happens because the commits of the branch are just "flattened"
with the base branch and the branch references point both to the head. No commits involved, so no history.

git merge <branch_to_merge> (In the branch that should receive branch_to_merge, merges branch_to_merge with FF merging)

-- No-Fast-Forward Merging --
The fact that a branch has been created is preserved in git history, even when, once merged, the branch is deleted.
This happens because No-FF merge happens through a merge-commit.

git merge <branch_to_merge> --no-ff (In the branch that should receive branch_to_merge, merges branch_to_merge with No-FF merging)

-- 3-Way Merging --
Happens when both the target branch and the feature branch diverged over time. Creates a merge commit and preserve history.
It is called 3-Way merging because it needs 3 commits to create the merge commit: the two tips and their common ancestor.

git merge <branch_to_merge> -m "commit message"

-- Merge conflict resolution --
Merge conflicts can happen only during a 3-Way merge:
git merge <branch_to_merge>

Git says the automatic merge has failed and needs conflict resolution.
git mergetool (opens the merge tool for conflict resolution)

- 17 - Commit History Rewriting in git -
Amending commits means modifying a commit so that it will include subsequent modifications done in other commit.
git commit --amend --no-edit (Il commit successivo viene incluso nel precedente, senza modificare il commit message (no-edit). commit-id changes. Not to use with pushed changes).

-- git rebase --
Rebasing is the process of moving a branch into a git base commit.
git rebase <BASE> (In the branch I want to rebase, where base is a branch, a commit_id, a tag or a reference, like HEAD)
After this operation, the master branch is behind and a FF-Merge is possible.
git checkout master
git merge <branch_to_merge>

-- Rebasing Conflict Resolution --
git checkout <branch_to_rebase>
git rebase <BASE> (Start rebasing to BASE, from the branch we want to rebase.)
git rebase --abort (After a conflict, we can decide to not merge and aborting the rebase, going back to the previous situation before the rebase)
git mergetool (Start the tool to resolve merge conflicts)
git rebase --continue (after we've solved conflicts, continue the rebase process)
git checkout BASE_branch (to finally move to the rebased branch)
git merge <branch_to_rebase> (to apply a FF merge and update the HEAD)
git branch -d branch_to_rebase (to finally delete the not needed anymore branch)

-- git fetch --
Synchronize the origin/master with the remote repository. origin/master is the local copy of the remote repo.
git fetch (Updated the local copy with the origin)
git merge (Needed to merge the update with the local branch)

*** Da approfondire ***

-- Git Pull with Rebase --
Local git maintains not only local repositories but also local copies of remote repositories.
Sometimes it's easier not to merge in the upstream content but reapplying own changes on top of the upcoming commits.
For small changesets, history stays cleaner and linear using a pull with rebase. For longer feature set, traditional git pull is more approprieate.
git pull --rebase origin master
